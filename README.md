# Darts-Engine
This is a collaborative project with [Ethan Buckner](url), [Kieran O'Dell](url), and [Ben Walker](url) for the 2022 HooHacks Competition. We designed a program using Python that strategizes for the dart game Cricket and is capable of playing against a human user and simulates dart throws displayed on a digital board using NumPy.
