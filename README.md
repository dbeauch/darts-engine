# Darts-Engine
This is a collaborative project with [Ethan Buckner](https://github.com/ethan-buckner), [Kieran O'Dell](https://github.com/KieranOdell), and [Ben Walker](https://github.com/BenAlWalker) for the 2022 HooHacks Competition. We designed a program using Python that strategizes for the dart game Cricket and is capable of playing against a human user and simulates dart throws displayed on a digital board using NumPy.
